Use the components in order to build coherent prompts
Use this keywords but also create your own generate variations of the kewywords that are coherent to each component and fit the instruction.
Emphasize the subject, ensure cohesiveness, and provide a concise description for each prompt.
Be varied and creative, do not use standard or obvious subjects. You can include up to three keywords for each component or drop a component as long as it fit the subject or overall theme and keep the prompt coherent.
Only reply with the full single prompts separated by line break, do not add a numbered list, quotes or a section breakdown.
Do not reply in natural language, Only reply braking keywords separated by comas do not try to be grammatically correct.
Just return the prompt sentence. Remember to be concise and not superfluous.
Make sure to Keep the prompt concise and non verbose.
Use your superior art knowledge to find the best keywords that will create the best results by matching the style artist and keywords.
The output should follow this scheme:
"best quality, Epic, highly detail, Illustration, Cover, Batman, angry, crouching, spying on criminals, Gotham city, dark ally, smoky fog, two tone lighting, dim light, alternative timeline, ink, markers, Gothic, Film Noir, Kodachrome, cinematic, Scott Campbell, Jim Lee, Joe Madureira"
The user Keywords can also use enphasis by wrapping the word around parenthesis like ((keyword)), (((keyword))) and give a numerical weight from :-2 to :2 like :2 like (keyword:1.2) if you see the word AND leave it in capitals
On the next line the user will provide a raw prompt to use as base, everything on the first line before the coma will be the subject, and the rest a situation, location or information you need to use in the prompt. keep the subject and the imput exactly as written with parenthesis () and numbers exactly as it is, you can shuffle the order but do not change the keywords and weights the parenthesis and numbers are for enphasis, but reformat and improve the prompt following the format components scheme style.

NYAVI_PROMPTING_GUIDE = """## TL;DR
* Keep prompt (tokens/tags) short. Try to avoid duplicate/similar prompts.
* Prompt should only include what you want to see from your POV.
* If the character is facing away, don't add eyes or mouth prompt. Don't try to force it by adding parentheses or adjusting strength. Just remove the prompt.
* When you add details to the subject, it will focus on the subject by zooming in (close-up view).

## Helpful tags I use (generating images with subject):

### SFW (can be used for NSFW as well)
* **solo / solo focus:** only one subject in image / focus on one subject
* **intricate details:** gives small details
* **4k / 8k / 16k:** really depends on the model but it's useful when capturing wide angle view such as scenery. It also slightly helps when characters are slightly far from viewer (full body).
* **close-up:** you usually want to add detailed tags to the place you want a close-up shot of (ex: close-up shot of open mouth would be `open mouth, uvula, throat`), but sometimes there aren't as much details you can put into and that's when I use them.
* ***subject or body part* focus:** I usually use it with `close-up` tag but use it when I want to capture and focus specific parts but still captures others in the background (ex: when its `overhead view` of subjects head but also captures their chest and feet).
* **small face:** usually gives smaller face of the subject by either shifting their body backwards or literally shrinking the face.
* **Positions:** this tag is bit more complicated depending on what kind of pose you want the character to take.
    * **lying on back / on stomach / on side.** You can also add `upside-down` to have head focus.
    * **standing / walking:** it does what it states.
    * **running:** it runs! You can add `motion lines` or `emphasis lines` for action shots.
    * **etc:** there's too many position for me to cover ;;
* **Camera angles:** (special thanks to NanashiAnon)
    This one is VERY important. It's also important to combine with "facing *direction*"
    * **from top / below / side / behind:** where do you want to place the camera? These are basic tags but you can add more detailed angles such as:
        * **full body:** captures the subject from head to toe
        * **low angle view:** shots from below
        * **overhead view:** great top-down view
        * **dutch angle:** Angled shot. Helps add movement to the image.
    * **Partially capturing subject:**
        * **upper body / lower body:** captures the subject's waist-ish and up / captures the subject's waist-ish and below
        * **portrait:** captures the subject's chest or armpit and above
        * **cowboy shot:** captures the subject's thigh and above
    * ***body part* out of frame:** specific body part will be excluded from the frame
        * **head / hand(s) / foot / feet / etc...**
* ***Clothing*:** I'll go over this in another article since it is a bit complicated depending on the model

### NSFW
* **mature / adult:** it's an etiquette. Let's generate and experience pleasant NSFW images.
* **completely nude:** butt naked!
* ***size* breasts: small / medium / large:** Breast size correlates to character size so beware when using "small breasts". It should be fine as long as it has `mature` and `adult` tag in it but it really depends on the model. AI isn't perfect. Personally I like medium to semi large :)
* **pussy / clitoris / anus:** really depends on model. NSFW model will auto generate it if other tags are stating that the person is flashing the area (ex: `spread legs`)
* **vaginal / anal:** more important than "~~sex~~" tag. Make sure to add `penis` or other object tag.
* **pov:** you are the one in action.
* **disembodied *body part*:** one of my favorite tag. It sounds SUS but it's not. It gives flexibility to angles and positions without blocking views.
    * **hands:** "breast grab", "spread pussy", "leg grab"... whatever you want to grab. You can also grab me a cup of coffee!
    * **tongue:** usually I use it for licking body parts. Useful for "cunnilingus" as well.
    * **penis:** another great tag for penetration from impossible angles. Quite useful for group sex as well.
* **motion lines:** You'd want movement and action in your image.
    * **bouncing *body parts*:** breasts / ass / testicles
    * **unaligned *body parts*:** breasts / ass / testicles

IMAGE_PROMPTING_GUIDE = """# Image prompting guide

An image prompt is a string that will be fed into an AI image generation model such as Dalle and stable diffusion. It's important to know that they're trained on images and image descriptions, which means they're not smart and we can't just give general descriptions and leave it to them to fill in the blanks, rather we need to explicitly specify all the details we want, and we might even have to repeat the keywords in the beginning and the end so that the model doesn't ignore it.
For the image prompt, be extremely descriptive and use Danbooru tags as well.

Here are some examples of what the desired outcome is, and then the good image prompt worked and generated the desired image.

Note that you need to mention the number of people in there, for example if there's one girl in the image, use the Danbooru tag "1girl", disambiguate as many things as possible.
Some things about syntax: surrounding things with parenthesis (()) multiplies the effectiveness of the keyword, and you can even use fractions like this: "(sexy:1.2)" this will add an extra 20% emphasis.

Focus on the content of the image more than the style. Note that some of these prompts focus on the style and lighting etc, that's optional and you can add your own style based on the context, but you need to focus on the content of the images and the actions and the people.
